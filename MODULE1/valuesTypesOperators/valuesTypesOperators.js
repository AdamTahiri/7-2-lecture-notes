// JS numbers can be floats (decimals), positive, negative, etc.. .
// Can do math with numbers
// NaN (Not a Number) is of type number 

// Strings being added to each other is called string concatenation. 
// We can add strings. Strings added to anything become a string. 

// Booleans are true or false. They are their own data type 

// Comparrison Operators 
// === - triple equals for strict equality match. Evaluates to a boolean. 
// !== - Not equal to 
// Also have <, >, <=, >= for comparisons. 

// Logical Operator
// ! mean NOT 
// && AND (are both sides truthy ? )
// || OR (at least one side truthy)

// Things are truthy or falsy. 

// Falsy values in JS:
//  0 / -0
//  false
//  NaN 
//  null
// undefined 
// ""

// These will become super important when dealing with conditionals.
